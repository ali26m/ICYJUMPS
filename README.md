# ICYJUMPS

Icyjumps is a game based on the idea of icytower but instead of moving the scene up the character is spawned at the bottom of the window and tries to go to the flag at the top of the window by jumping on horizontal objects before the time hits zero. We developed the game using C++ programming language and OpenGL API. The game window is of size 1200:700 pixels with position (100,50) with respect to player screen dimensions.

Let's run!

## Controls

The controls are easy just up arrow for the jump, left/right for moving left/right, and don't worry about going down the gravity will do it's work (you don't want to go down as you don't have to much time).
